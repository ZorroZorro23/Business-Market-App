# Business Market App – Map Radius Finder

## Overview
Business Market App is a client-side web application that helps users explore and analyze locations within a selected geographic radius.  
The app focuses on simplicity, usability, and real user interaction, following the same architectural and evaluation style as the course example projects (e.g. News Analyser).

## Problem Statement
Finding relevant businesses or points of interest within a specific distance can be inefficient without visual filtering tools.  
This application addresses the problem by allowing users to interact with a map and define a radius to better understand nearby market opportunities.

## Features
- Interactive web interface
- Map-based visualization
- Radius-based area selection
- Simple login/demo entry page
- User interaction tracking for adoption analysis
- Responsive and lightweight front-end design

## Technology Stack
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (Vanilla)
- Client-side analytics (for user adoption metrics)

## Application Structure
- `login.html` – Entry point for the application
- `index.html` – Main application page
- `assets/` – Stylesheets, scripts, and static resources

## Architecture
The application follows a simple client-side architecture:
- UI handled through HTML and CSS
- Application logic implemented in JavaScript
- No backend or database required
- User adoption measured using analytics tools rather than persistent user accounts

## User Adoption & Analytics
A *live user* is defined as a real person who accesses and interacts with the application during the evaluation period.

Tracked metrics include:
- Number of active users
- Sessions
- User interactions (page load, map usage, radius changes)

These metrics are used to demonstrate adoption and engagement, in line with course requirements.

## How to Run
1. Clone or download the repository
2. Open `login.html` or `index.html` in a browser  
   (recommended: Live Server extension)
3. Interact with the application via the map interface

## Future Improvements
- Backend integration for persistent user accounts
- Advanced filtering and categorization
- Data persistence and saved locations
- Enhanced analytics and reporting
- Improved UI/UX and mobile optimization
